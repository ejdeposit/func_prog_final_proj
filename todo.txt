- x code up game of life
- x figure out how to print board
- x start basic stack project
- x add unit tests
- x start coding cellular atamaton 
- x split functions into smaller ones where possible
- write remaining tests
- allow user to enter size
- allow user to enter rule set


Notes:
- stack install seems to not work, possibly reinstalled GHCi but path not modified like it needs to be.  use stack build and stack run instead
- stack test works
- stack build seems to automatically add new libraries to .cabal file
- stack install necessary for running main instead of using interpreter.  Much faster
