- code up game of life
- figure out how to print board
- start basic stack project
- add unit tests
- start coding cellular atamaton 

Notes:
- stack install seems to not work, possibly reinstalled GHCi but path not modified like it needs to be.  use stack build and stack run instead
- stack test works
- stack build seems to automatically add new libraries to .cabal file
